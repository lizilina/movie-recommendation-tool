# movie-recommendation-tool
This Python script interacts with the OMDb API to fetch details about movies based on user input. It displays movie details such as title, year, rating, runtime, and plot summary, and provides recommendations based on IMDb ratings. The script saves fetched data to a JSON file and a SQLite database for easy access and storage of movie details.
